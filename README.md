# Just in Time Self-Storage 

**Just in Time Self-Storage** is a multi-page company website that I developed and designed for a self-storage facility based in Mississauga, Ontario. They wanted to develop a website in order to gain more traction to their business. There was a lot of emphasis placed on making this website SEO-friendly and accessible to all users.
